# Functional assignment

This assigment will introduce you to some of python more used functional features.

## Task 1: Function registration (5 points)

Look at task_1.py and fill in the implementation. Running test_task_1.py will
let you know if it is correct.


## Task 2: Decorative logging (5 points)

Open task_2.py and fill in the implementation. Use test_task_2.py to check
if it is working.

## Task 3: Simple DataClasses (5 points)

Take a look at python's [data classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html).
They are an excellent option for making basic data containers and even offer (shallow)
immutability. Next, open task_3.py and create a simple dataclass.


## Task 4: Recursive Rascality (10 points)

One of the natural fits for recursion is parsing tree-like data structures. Here we will
traverse a nested tree structure to pull out data of interest.

You will need to first install pydantic via:

```bash
pip install pydantic
```

Then take a look at task_4.py. Three simple recursive functions need to be implemented.
`count_creatures`, `classify_creatures`, `filter_creatures_by_name`

As always, running the tests in test_tasK_4.py will let you know how you are doing.
